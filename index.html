    <h2>CSR and Sustainability</h2>
    <p>
      Our smart mood lamp is designed to promote emotional wellness by recognizing how you feel and responding with personalized music that uplifts and balances your mood. By blending real-time mood detection with the power of music therapy, we’re introducing an innovative solution that fills a critical gap in everyday mental health support.
      <br><br>
      In line with the United Nations' <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being</strong>, our product helps users maintain a positive mental state in their daily lives. Beyond emotional support, we’re committed to sustainability. The lamp is crafted using eco-friendly, recycled materials, powered by energy-saving LEDs and rechargeable batteries, and produced locally to minimize packaging waste and carbon emissions — contributing to <strong>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</strong>.
      <br><br>
      As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, we partner with mental health organizations, work to make our product accessible to underserved communities, and lead awareness campaigns and educational initiatives across schools, universities, and workplaces.
