      <h2>CSR and Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Our product supports emotional well-being by detecting a userâ€™s mood and playing tailored music to improve their state.

Aligned with SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, the lamp aims to boost mood and support better mental health in everyday life. By using recycled, sustainable materials, energy-efficient LEDs, rechargeable batteries, and local manufacturing to reduce packaging waste and transport-related emissions, the lamp also supports SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, we aim to collaborate with mental health organizations, offer affordable access to underserved communities, and raise awareness through campaigns and educational programs in schools, universities, and workplaces.</p>
